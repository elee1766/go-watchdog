go-watchdog runs a singleton memory watchdog in the process, which watches
memory utilization and forces Go GC in accordance with a user-defined policy.

There are two kinds of watchdog so far:

* **heap-driven:** applies a limit to the heap, and obtains current usage through
  `runtime.ReadMemStats()`.
* **system-driven:** applies a limit to the total system memory used, and obtains
  current usage through [`elastic/go-sigar`](https://github.com/elastic/gosigar).

A third process-driven watchdog that uses cgroups is underway.

This library ships with two policies out of the box:

* watermarks policy: runs GC at configured watermarks of system or heap memory
  utilisation.
* adaptive policy: runs GC when the current usage surpasses a dynamically-set
  threshold.
  
You can easily build a custom policy tailored to the allocation patterns of your
program.

## Why is this even needed?

The garbage collector that ships with the go runtime is pretty good in some
regards (low-latency, negligible no stop-the-world), but it's insatisfactory in
a number of situations that yield ill-fated outcomes:

1. it is incapable of dealing with bursty/spiky allocations efficiently;
   depending on the workload, the program may OOM as a consequence of not
   scheduling GC in a timely manner.
2. part of the above is due to the fact that go doesn't concern itself with any
   limits. To date, it is not possible to set a maximum heap size. 
2. its default policy of scheduling GC when the heap doubles, coupled with its
   ignorance of system or process limits, can easily cause it to OOM.
