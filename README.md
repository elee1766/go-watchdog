# Go memory watchdog

> üê∫ A library to curb OOMs by running Go GC according to a user-defined policy.

go-watchdog runs a singleton memory watchdog. It takes system and heap memory
readings periodically, and feeds them to a user-defined policy to determine
whether GC needs to run immediately.

This library ships with two policies out of the box:

* watermarks policy: runs GC at configured watermarks of system or heap memory
  utilisation.
* adaptive: runs GC when the current usage surpasses a dynamically-set
  threshold.
  
You can easily build a custom policy tailored to the allocation patterns of your
program.

It is recommended that you set both (a) a memory limit and (b) a scope of
application of that limit (system or heap) when you start the watchdog.
Otherwise, go-watchdog will use the system scope, and will default to the
total system memory as the limit. [elastic/go-sigar](https://github.com/elastic/gosigar)
is used to make the discovery.

## Why is this even needed?

The garbage collector that ships with the go runtime is pretty good in some
regards (low-latency, negligible no stop-the-world), but it's insatisfactory in
a number of situations that yield ill-fated outcomes:

1. it is incapable of dealing with bursty/spiky allocations efficiently;
   depending on the workload, the program may OOM as a consequence of not
   scheduling GC in a timely manner.
2. part of the above is due to the fact that go doesn't concern itself with any
   limits. To date, it is not possible to set a maximum heap size. 
2. its default policy of scheduling GC when the heap doubles, coupled with its
   ignorance of system or process limits, can easily cause it to OOM.
